<p><b>Introduction to Programming: ASSIGNMENT 1</b></p>

<p>The WWW is a collection of <em>HTML documents</em> (Hypertext Markup Language). This is what glues disparate documents together.<br>
The web has around 30 billion pages.</p>

<p>The major components of the web are: <br><br>

<b>USERS </b>(you) <br>
<b>COMPUTER/BROWSER </b>i.e. <em>Firefox</em> (where you make the request top access a page for example)<br>
<b>INTERNET </b>(the medium by which the request is transmitted)  <br>
<b>SERVER </b> (computers optimised for hosting files) <br></p>

<p>HTML documents are the building blocks of the web. These documents are made of text (what you see) mark-up (what it looks like) <br>references to other documents (i.e. embedded music/videos/photos) or <em>hyperlinks</em> to other pages. </p>

<p>HTML markup is made up of <em>tags</em> which are instructions to the computer directing it how to display the text or other content.<br> Most, but not all, tags need both opening and closing tags i.e. <b> and </b> for bold text or <em> and </em> for italics.

A missing end tag will maintain <br>the previous instruction, i.e. an instruction to display in bold without an end tag will result in all subsequent text being in bold.</p>

Also HTML tags called <em>attributes</em> can be used to hyperlink text to websites i.e.<br><br>

visit <a href=“www.udacity.com”> udacity.com </a> <br><br>

or to link to images, often also with text i.e.<br> <br> <b>HELLO!</b> <img src = “http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png” alt “chipmunk!”><br><br> 

Image tags also should have <em> alternate tags </em>to display text for examples in the event of a missing image.</p>

<p>To have lines on a new line instead of being continuous you need to designate it with a tag, also known as a void tag.

The same <br>can be achieved with a 'p' or paragraph tag, which requires an end tag '/p'. 

  The difference between these two techniques is their type;<br> 'br' is an <em>inline</em> tag simply used to place subsequent text on a new line, and 'p' is a <em>block</em> tag which creates an invisible box around<br> the designated text, the height and weight of which can then be adjusted.<p>Programmers like to say that 'computers are stupid', not in a demeaning sense, but to highlight the fact that they require specific<br> instructions and cannot function as intended if these instructions are not precise to the letter. So a single character out of place<br> in a sequence of code will cause things to not come out as intended. </P>

<p>Other tags include <em>span</em> (inline) and <em>div</em> (block) which are used to assign different styles to sections of content. </p>
